All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-04-16
### Added
- startin v0.5 new features: 
  - interplation with natural neighbour (nni, or Sibson's method) is added. 
  - saving of the triangulation to GeoJSON is added
### Changed
- new name "startinpy" to avoid clashes with the rust lib "startin" on which this project is based on. Since I use a Rust builder (maturin), there were clashes and probably a better idea to call it "startinpy" anyway.
